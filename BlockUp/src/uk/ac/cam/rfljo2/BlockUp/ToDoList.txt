A temporary list of bugs and features that we need to discuss how to deal with.

- Finish implementing new colour method (DONE)
- Finish new implementation of blocks

- Replace all values repeated in many places ie. width and height with constants.
- Row clearing animation (flashing) needs the ability to pause gameplay whilst it plays
- Pressing quit on GameOver dialog does not properly kill the process
- Rotating a block when it is against the side can cause it to 'stick'
- Remove random stuff being printed to the console. Basically formalise how we debug things. Possibly establish a 'DEBUG' mode.

- Add a scoring system
? Use listeners and events to handle game logic
- Add power-ups!


=== Power Up Specifications ===

One in n blocks contains a power up block which when cleared gives a special effect.

Fire Block: 			Does something fiery.
Heavy block:			Upon landing, smashes through the blocks directly above it
Radioactive:			Causes some of the surrounding cells to decay over time, leaving gaps
Shuffle:				Some groups of surrounding cells move positions, potentially shifting gaps around
Air Strike: 			One or more missiles fire up at the board, making empty rows through it

Triple Line:			The next 3 blocks are all lines
Triple Square:			The next 3 blocks are all squares
Tetris God's Revenge:	The next 3 blocks are all REVERSE SQUIGGLY!

Colour Blind:			Remove all blocks of a certain colour
